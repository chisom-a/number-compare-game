# Number Comparing Game #
A number comparing game developed in Python using Tkinter for the GUI implementation. You type in a number between 1 to 100 and it'll let you know if the computer picks a number higher or lower than your number. There's also a secret if you type in a certain phrase.

# Files #
* `mainGUI.py` - Contains the code for the GUI version.
* `mainCLI.py` - Contains the code for the CLI version (you run it in a terminal).
* `icon.png` - The icon I created for the program.
* `Number Comparing Game Icon.odg` - The icon in its original file format (requires LibreOffice Draw or other programs that read .odg files).

# Development History #
I worked on this program from around May 2021 to July 2023 to become familiar with Python and the Tkinter interface. After trying out beginner programming tools, like Code.org and Scratch, I wanted to step out of my comfort zone and develop a program using tools developers use in the real world, so I picked Python and the Tkinter interface. While creating this program, I read online manuals and StackOverflow to figure out which code would work best with the tasks I had in mind and troubleshoot issues I encountered, like the program not reading the file or some buttons not being shown. I also wanted to make an icon for this program as if I were publishing it, so I used LibreOffice Draw to design it. The publishment of this program is for those interested in the personal projects I developed over the years.
